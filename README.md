# Google from the command line!
Something small I made when I got bored

***Make sure you have selenium webdriver and the proper drivers for your browser.***
which can be found at [here](https://www.seleniumhq.org)

Move google to your **/usr/local/bin**  and start using it in your next session!

About:
Busy coding want to see what time is sunset? Or what the grocery shop is closing? Or what the weather is like and will be later? Or what the score is for the game that you're missing because your busy with work? :(

Well you could google it....but that could also mean you might procrastinate on something else like Youtube, Facebook etc.
So why not set a timelimit for how long you want that page open? With google commandline you can do just that!



What I learned:
- How to user selenium webdriver in python (have used it before in other langauges)
- How to create command line utilities

Purpose of project:
- I just wanted to create a commandline utility
- This is actually a prototype to my **clockify-command** utility that I am developing to make my workflow better.
